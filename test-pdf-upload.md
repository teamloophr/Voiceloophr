- Try uploading a PDF file
- Look for any error messages

- Check the response status and body

### 3. Check Server Logs
- Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
- Look for any error messages when PDF is uploaded

### 4. Test with Different PDFs
- Try a simple, small PDF file
- Try a PDF created from Word/Google Docs
- Try a scanned PDF
- Try a PDF with just text (no images)

- Try with a PDF under 1MB first

## Expected Behavior
